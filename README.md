# underwater-sound-beacon
This repository contains the code, audio files, and 3D models required to build an underwater sound beacon for visually impaired swimmers. Read the full project description and build tutorial on [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/rhammell/underwater-sound-beacons-for-visually-impaired-swimmers-b1aa85)

## How It Works
This underwater sound beacon enables visually impaired swimmers to safely navigate through a pool using their sense of hearing.

The beacon consists of a 3D printed body anchored to the bottom of the pool with a weight. Positioned at the center of a swim lane and at a known distance from the pool's wall, the beacon's electronics produce repeating audio cues that propagate through the surrounding water, audible to nearby swimmers.

Swimmers with limited vision can listen for these cues, using the direction and intensity of the sound to determine their proximity to the beacon. This spatial awareness helps prevent them from colliding with the pool's wall and allows them to stay centered in the swim lane.
