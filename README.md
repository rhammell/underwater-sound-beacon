# How It Works

This underwater sound beacon enbables visually impaired swimmers to safely navigate through a pool using their sense of hearing. 

The beacon consists of a 3D printed body that is anchored to the bottom of the pool using a weight. It is positioned within the center of a swim lane, and a a known distance from the pool's wall.

Electronics within the beacon body produce repeating audio cues that can be heard nearby in the water. 

Swimmers with limited vision can listen for these cues as they swim, and use the direction and intensity of the sound to determine where they are in proximity to the beacon. This spatial awareness helps prevent them from swimming into the pool's wall and stay centered in the swim lane.
